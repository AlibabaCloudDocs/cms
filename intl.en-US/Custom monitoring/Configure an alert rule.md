# Configure an alert rule

Custom monitoring provides you with the alert feature. When you configure an alert rule, you need to select an application group. When an alert is triggered based on the alert rule, a notification is sent to the alert contacts of the application group.

Monitoring data is reported to Cloud Monitor. For more information, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Custom monitoring/Report monitoring data/Report monitoring data.md).

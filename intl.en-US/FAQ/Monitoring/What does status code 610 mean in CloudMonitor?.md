# What does status code 610 mean in CloudMonitor? {#concept_vhc_2vk_zdb .concept}

Status code 610 indicates an HTTP connection timeout. These connection timeouts occur when no response packet is returned within five seconds after CloudMonitor sends an HTTP request. If connection timeouts are frequent, we recommend that you increase the value of retry times and enable combined alarms for your corresponding alarm rules.

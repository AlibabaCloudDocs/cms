# Manage a custom dashboard

Cloud Monitor provides the dashboard feature. You can customize the monitoring data that a dashboard displays and view the monitoring data on the dashboard. If the default Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) dashboard of Cloud Monitor cannot meet your business needs, you can create a dashboard and add monitoring charts to view custom monitoring data. You can also modify or delete the dashboard.

## Create a dashboard

1.  Log on to the [Cloud Monitor console](https://cms-intl.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Dashboard** \> **Custom Dashboard**.

3.  On the Dashboards page, click **Create Dashboard** in the upper-right corner.

4.  In the Create Dashboard dialog box, enter a dashboard name.

5.  Click **Create**.

    You are redirected to the newly created dashboard. You can then add monitoring charts to the dashboard as needed. For more information, see [Add a monitoring chart](/intl.en-US/Dashboard/Manage monitoring charts on a custom dashboard.md).

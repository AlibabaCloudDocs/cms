# Overview

CloudMonitor provides dashboards for you to get an overview of services, view monitoring details, and troubleshoot issues. This topic describes how to use dashboards in different scenarios.

## Display the monitoring data of multiple instances

Assume that your application is deployed on multiple Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances. You can add the monitoring data of these ECS instances to the same monitoring chart to view the change trend of the monitoring data in one place. For example, you can view the change trend of the CPU usage for multiple ECS instances in the same monitoring chart.

## Display the monitoring data of multiple metrics

CloudMonitor allows you to view multiple metrics of an ECS instance, such as the CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage, in the same monitoring chart.

## Sort the resource consumption of instances in a specific order

Assume that you have 20 ECS instances. You can sort the CPU usage of the 20 instances in the descending order. Then, you can allocate resources based on the resource consumption to reduce unnecessary costs.

## Display the monitoring data distribution of multiple instances in real time

For example, you can view the CPU usage distribution of ECS instances and the differences of CPU usage between ECS instances by using a heatmap. You can click a color block to view the change trend of the monitoring data for an ECS instance within a time period.

## Display the aggregate data of a specific metric for multiple instances

For example, you can view the average CPU usage of multiple ECS instances in a monitoring chart. Then, you can find out the overall CPU usage of these instances and check whether the CPU usage of each instance is proper.

## Display a dashboard in full screen

Dashboards support the full-screen mode and automatically update monitoring data. You can add a variety of metrics to a dashboard and display the dashboard in full screen.

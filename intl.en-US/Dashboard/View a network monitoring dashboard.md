# View a network monitoring dashboard

You can view the monitoring data of the public IP address of an ECS instance and the elastic IP address \(EIP\) associated with the ECS instance. By default, Cloud Monitor provides the monitoring dashboards of Internet outbound bandwidth, Internet inbound bandwidth, and Internet outbound bandwidth usage.

The data on the network monitoring page includes the traffic generated when public IP addresses access each other within the same region and across different regions. The Internet bandwidth of the host monitoring does not contain the bandwidth occupied by the network monitoring. Therefore, the monitoring data displayed on this page may be greater than the Internet bandwidth on the host monitoring page.

1.  Log on to the[Cloud Monitor console](https://cms-intl.console.aliyun.com).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Dashboard** \> **Flow chart**.

3.  Select the time range of the monitoring charts.

    **Note:** You can query the monitoring data of only the last 30 days.

4.  Select the public IP address of the ECS instance from the **IP address** drop-down list.

# Report monitoring data {#concept_b2h_ddb_5db .concept}

This topic describes how to report custom monitoring data.

Custom monitoring allows you to customize metrics and alert rules to meet your own business needs. Custom monitoring provides APIs for reporting monitoring data. You can use the APIs to report collected time series data to CloudMonitor. You can also configure alert rules to receive alert notification when an exception occurs.

CloudMonitor provides three methods to report data: APIs, Java SDK, and Alibaba Cloud command line interface \(CLI\).

## Limits {#section_q4b_znk_zdb .section}

-   The number of queries per second \(QPS\) is limited to 200 in China \(Beijing\), China \(Shanghai\), and China \(Hangzhou\), 100 in China \(Zhangjiakou-Beijing Winter Olympics\) and China \(Shenzhen\), and 50 in the other regions.
-   A maximum of 100 data entries can be reported at a time. The body size cannot exceed 256 KB.
-   The `metricName` field can contain letters, digits, and underscores \(\_\). This field must start with a letter. If the starting character is not a letter it is replaced with an uppercase A. Invalid characters are replaced with underscores \(\_\).
-   The `dimensions` field cannot contain equal signs \(=\), ampersands \(&\), or commas \(,\). Invalid characters are replaced with underscores \(\_\).
-   The string length of the key or value of both `metricName` and `dimensions` parameters cannot exceed 64 bytes. Otherwise, the key or value string is truncated.
-   Reporting raw data is a paid function. The free edition allows you to aggregate data. When you report data, you must pass "1" for the Type field to the request parameter.

## Report data through APIs {#section_zym_l4k_zdb .section}

After you report the raw data through APIs, CloudMonitor uses the following statistical methods to calculate the statistics at 1-minute and 5-minute intervals:

-   Average: the average value
-   Maximum: the maximum value
-   Minimum: the minimum value
-   Sum: the sum value
-   SampleCount: the count
-   SumPerSecond: the sum divided by the total number of seconds of the corresponding aggregation period. You can also use the moving average calculation.
-   CountPerSecond: the count divided by the total number of seconds of the corresponding aggregation period. You can also use the moving average calculation.
-   LastValue: the last sampled value in the aggregation period. It is similar to gauge.
-   P10: The value of the 10th percentile. It is greater than 10% of all data in the aggregation period.
-   P20: The value of the 20th percentile. It is greater than 20% of all data in the aggregation period.
-   P30: The value of the 30th percentile. It is greater than 30% of all data in the aggregation period.
-   P40: The value of the 40th percentile. It is greater than 40% of all data in the aggregation period.
-   P50: The value of the 50th percentile. It is the median and greater than 50% of all data in the aggregation period.
-   P60: The value of the 60th percentile. It is greater than 60% of all data in the aggregation period.
-   P70: The value of the 70th percentile. It is greater than 70% of all data in the aggregation period.
-   P75: The value of the 75th percentile. It is greater than 75% of all data in the aggregation period.
-   P80: The value of the 80th percentile. It is greater than 80% of all data in the aggregation period.
-   P90: The value of the 90th percentile. It is greater than 90% of all data in the aggregation period.
-   P95: The value of the 95th percentile. It is greater than 95% of all data in the aggregation period.
-   P98: The value of the 98th percentile. It is greater than 98% of all data in the aggregation period.
-   P99: The value of the 99th percentile. It is greater than 99% of all data in the aggregation period.

-   **Request syntax**

    ```
    POST /metric/custom/upload HTTP/1.1 
    Authorization:<AuthorizationString>
    Content-Length:<Content Length>
    Content-MD5:<Content MD5>

    ```


-   **Signature algorithm**

    Currently, the only supported signature algorithm is HMAC-SHA1.

    1.  Prepare an Alibaba Cloud AccessKey pair.

        To generate a digital signature for an API request, you must use an AccessKey pair that is composed of an AccessKey ID and an AccessKey Secret. You can use an existing AccessKey pair or create a new one. The AccessKey pair must be in the **Active** state.

    2.  Generate a signature string for the request

        An API signature string consists of the Method, Header, and Body fields of an HTTP request.

        ```
        SignString = VERB + "\n"
                     + CONTENT-MD5 + "\n"
                     + CONTENT-TYPE + "\n"
                     + DATE + "\n"
                     + CanonicalizedHeaders + "\n"
                     + CanonicalizedResource
        ```

        In the preceding formula, `\n` indicates the newline escape character and the plus sign \(`+`\) indicates the string concatenation operator. The other parts are defined as follows:

        |Name|Definition|Examples|
        |:---|:---------|:-------|
        |VERB|The method name of the HTTP request|PUT, GET, and POST|
        |CONTENT-MD5|The MD5 value of the Body field in the HTTP request, which must be an uppercase string|875264590688CA6171F6228AF5BBB3D2|
        |CONTENT-TYPE|The type of the Body field in the request|application/json|
        |DATE|The standard timestamp header of the HTTP request, which follows the RFC 1123 format and uses GMT standard time|Mon, 3 Jan 2010 08:33:47 GMT|
        |CanonicalizedHeaders|The string constructed by the custom headers prefixed with x-cms and x-acs in the HTTP request|x-cms-api-version:0.1.0\\nx-cms-signature|
        |CanonicalizedResource|The string constructed by the HTTP request resources, as described in the following section|/event/custom/upload|

        CanonicalizedHeaders in the preceding table is constructed as follows:

        1.  Convert the names of all HTTP request headers prefixed with `x-acs` and `x-acs` to lowercase letters.
        2.  Sort the CMS custom request headers obtained in the preceding step in ascending lexicographical order.
        3.  Delete any spaces on either side of a delimiter between the request header and content.
        4.  Separate all headers and content with separators \(`\n`\) to form the final CanonicalizedHeaders.
        CanonicalizedResource in the preceding table is constructed as follows:

        1.  Set CanonicalizedResource as an empty string \(""\).
        2.  Place the URI that you want to access, such as `/event/custom/upload`, between the quotation marks.
        3.  If the request contains a query string \(`QUERY_STRING`\), add a question mark \(`?`\) and the query string to the end of the CanonicalizedResource string.

            `QUERY_STRING` is the lexicographic string of request parameters included in the URL. Equal signs \(`=`\) are placed between the names and values of parameters to form a string. The key-value pairs are then sorted in ascending lexicographical order and connected with ampersands \(`&`\) to form a string. The formula is as follows:

            ```
            QUERY_STRING = "KEY1=VALUE1" + "&" + "KEY2=VALUE2"
            ```

    3.  Generate a digital signature for the request

        Currently, the only supported signature algorithm is HMAC-SHA1. The following formula is used to generate a signature:

        ```
        Signature = base16(hmac-sha1(UTF8-Encoding-Of(SignString), AccessKeySecret))
        ```

-   **Request parameters**

    |Name|Type|Required?|Description|
    |:---|:---|:--------|:----------|
    |groupId|Long|Yes|The ID of an application group.|
    |metricName|String|Yes|The name of a metric. A metric name can contain letters, digits, and connectors such as underscores \(\_\), hyphens \(-\), periods \(.\), forward slashes \(/\), and backslashes \(\\\). Other characters are invalid. The maximum length is 64 bytes. Excess characters will be truncated from the string.|
    |dimensions|Object|Yes|The dimension map. All key-value pairs are strings. A string can contain letters, digits, and connectors such as underscores \(\_\), hyphens \(-\), periods \(.\), forward slashes \(/\), and backslashes \(\\\). The maximum number of key-value pairs is 10. The maximum length of a key is 64 bytes. The maximum length of a value is 64 bytes. Excess characters will be truncated from the string.|
    |time|String|Yes|The time at which the metric value is generated. It supports timestamps in the "yyyyMMdd'T'HHmmss.SSSZ" format or long format, such as 20171012T132456.888+0800 or 1508136760000.|
    |type|Integer|Yes| The data type of the reported value. 0 indicates raw data and 1 indicates aggregate data.

 When you report aggregate data, we recommend that you report data for both 60s and 300s aggregation periods. Otherwise, you will not be able to query monitoring data that is older than seven days.

 |
    |period|String|No| The aggregation period. Unit: second.

 If the preceding Type parameter is set to 1, this field is required. Valid values: 60 or 300.

 |
    |values|Object|Yes|The collection of metric values. If type is 0, the key must be "value" and raw data is reported. CloudMonitor aggregates raw data over the aggregation period into several data types, such as maximum, count, and sum.|


## Report data through the Java SDK {#section_ecw_2h5_xfb .section}

-   **Install Java SDK**

    When you install Java SDK through Maven, the following dependencies must be added:

    ```

    ```

-   Run the following command to update the SDK:

    ```
    sudo pip install âupgrade aliyun-python-sdk-cms
    ```


**Report monitoring data**

Use the PutCustomMetric API to report the monitoring data.

-   Example for a Windows system:

    ```
    aliyuncli.exe cms PutCustomMetric --MetricList "[{'groupId':1,'metricName':'testMetric','dimensions':{'sampleName1':'value1','sampleName2':'value2'},'type':0,'values':{'value':10.5}}]"
    ```

-   Example for a Linux system:

    ```
    aliyuncli cms PutCustomMetric --MetricList "[{'groupId':1,'metricName':'testMetric','dimensions':{'sampleName1':'value1','sampleName2':'value2'},'type':0,'values':{'value':10.5}}]"
    ```

-   If the data is reported successfully, status code 200 is returned.

    ```
    {
    "Code":"200"
    }
    ```


**Error codes**

|Error code|Description|
|:---------|:----------|
|200|Normal.|
|206| Partially successful.

 If "reach Max time series num" is returned, you have reached the maximum amount of time series. We recommend that you purchase a higher quota or remove unnecessary time series.

 If "not allowed original value, please upgrade service" is returned, you are using the free edition, which cannot support raw data.

 If "type is invalid" is returned, the value of the type parameter is invalid. Ensure that the value of this parameter is 0 or 1.

 |
|400|Syntax error in a client request.|
|403|Verification failure, speed limit, or not authorized.|
|500|Internal server error|

**RAM user authorization**

You must grant CloudMonitor permissions to the corresponding RAM user before event data can be reported with the RAM user AK. If these permissions are not granted, the prompt "cannot upload, please use ram to auth" will be displayed when you report data.

1.  Log on to the [RAM console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/ram).
2.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Users** to go to the Users page.
3.  Click **Authorize** in the Actions column corresponding to the RAM user.

    ![](http://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/6163/15565294704851_en-US.png)

4.  On the authorization page, select **AliyunCloudMonitorFullAccess** and click **OK**.

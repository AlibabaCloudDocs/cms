# Server Load Balancer {#concept_by4_yqt_xdb .concept}

By monitoring multiple metrics from Server Load Balancer \(SLB\), including inbound and outbound traffic and the number of data packets and connections, CloudMonitor helps you to monitor the running status of instances and configure alarm rules accordingly. CloudMonitor automatically collects data from SLB from the time after you create an SLB instance.

## â€‹Alarm service {#section_z4b_ktm_vdb .section}

-   **Parameters**
    -   **Products**: ECS, RDS, OSS, among others
    -   **Resource Range**: the range for which an alarm rule takes effect. There are three alarm rule ranges available: **All Resources**, **Application Group**, and **Instances**.
        -   **All Resources**: Indicates that the specified alarm rule applies to all instances under a user name. For example, if you set the resource range to all resources, and set the alarm threshold for MongoDB CPU usage to 80%, then an alarm is triggered when the CPU usage of any MongoDB instance exceeds 80%. When you select **All Resources**, you can report an alarm for up to 1,000 resources. If the number of your resources exceeds 1,000, alarms cannot be reported for some resources even if they exceed the threshold you set in your alarm rule. Therefore, for these scenarios, we recommend that you use application groups to divide resources by service before setting up alarm rules to avoid this issue.
        -   **Application Group**: Indicates that the specified rule applies to all instances under an application group. For example, if you set the resource range to **Application Group** and set the alarm threshold for host CPU usage to 80%, then an alarm is triggered when the CPU usage of any host in the corresponding application group exceeds 80%.
        -   **Instances**: Indicates that the specified rule only applies to a specific instance. For example, if you set the resource range to **Instances** and set the alarm threshold for host CPU usage to 80%, an alarm is triggered when the CPU usage of the specified instance exceeds 80%.
    -   **Alarm Rule**: the alarm rule name
    -   **Rule Describe**: the main content of the alarm rule where you define the alarm-triggering conditions, or value threshold, for related metrics. For example, if you describe the rule as **1-minute average CPU usage \>=90%**, the alarm service will check every minute whether the average value of CPU usage within one minute meets or exceeds 90%.

        Consider the following example. For the alarm service in host monitoring, one data point is reported in 15 seconds for a single server metric, and 20 data points in five minutes. This relates to the following alarm rules.

        -   **5-minute average CPU usage \> 90%**: The average CPU usage value of the 20 data points in five minutes exceeds 90%.
        -   **5-minute CPU usage always \> 90%**: The CPU usage values of the 20 data points in five minutes all exceed 90%.
        -   **5-minute CPU usage once \> 90%**: The CPU usage value of at least one of the 20 data points in five minutes exceeds 90%.
        -   **Total 5-minute Internet outbound traffic \> 50 MB**: The sum of the outbound traffic values of the 20 data points in five minutes exceeds 50 MB.
    -   **Muted For**: the period of time that an alarm has been muted so that alarm contacts do not receive any alarm notifications during this period. An alarm rule can be muted up to 24 hours \(or 1 day\).
    -   **Triggered when threshold is exceeded for**: An alarm notification is sent if the detected values reach the alarm rule threshold a certain number of times consecutively.
    -   **Effective Period**: the period of time for which an alarm rule is effective. During this period of time, the alarm service checks metric data and determines whether to generate an alarm.
    -   **Notification Contact**: a group of contacts who receive alarm notifications.
    -   **Notification Methods**:
        -   Email and DingTalk chatbot
    -   **Email Subject**: The email subject is set as the product name, metric, and instance ID involved in the alarm by default.
    -   **Email Remark**: supplementary information customized for an alarm email. Remarks are sent as part of the alarm notification email.
    -    **HTTP CallBack**: Enter a URL accessible through the Internet and CloudMonitor will push the alarm information to the address through a POST request. Currently, only HTTP is supported.
-   **Set an alarm rule**

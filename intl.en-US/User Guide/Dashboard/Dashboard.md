# Dashboard {#concept_od3_d4y_5db .concept}

With the launch of the dashboard function in the CloudMonitor, Alibaba Cloud offers you a one-stop metric visualization solution.

## It allows you to view detailed metrics for troubleshooting and provides a quick view of the realtime services. {#section_isz_44y_5db .section}

For example, if one of your applications is deployed on multiple ECS instances, you can add metric data of these ECS instances to the same metric chart to view the change trend of the metric data of multiple machines. For example, the CPU usage of multiple ECS instances can be displayed in the time sequence in one chart.

## Display the ordering of instance resource consumption {#section_ptf_3qy_5db .section}

For example, a metric chart can display multiple metrics of an ECS instance, including CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage.

## Display the ordering of instance resource consumption {#section_vmq_ssy_5db .section}

For example, if you have 20 instances you can view all these instances in descending order in the table.   This gives you a quick understanding about resource consumption, how to use resources rationally and avoid unnecessary cost.

## Display the realtime metric data distribution of multiple instances {#section_j4k_bty_5db .section}

For example, the CPU usage distribution of an ECS instance group can be displayed in a heat map. This helps to What is the level of usage compared to other machines. You can click a color block to view the metric data trend of the corresponding machine in a specified period of time.

## Display the aggregated data of a particular metric of multiple instances {#section_pbx_pty_5db .section}

For example, you can view the average aggregation value of the CPU usage of multiple ECS instances in one chart, to know about the overall CPU usage and check whether the resource usage of each instance is balanced.

## Full-screen display {#section_uk4_15y_5db .section}

The dashboard supports full-screen display and automatic data refresh. You can add various product metrics to the dashboard and can view them in a full-screen mode.

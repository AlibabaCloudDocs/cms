# Use event monitoring {#concept_idt_k3b_wdb .concept}

Event monitoring provides reporting, querying, and warning capabilities for event type data. You can conveniently collect and report exceptions or important changes in services to CloudMonitor, and receive alerts when exceptions occur.

What are the differences between event monitoring and custom monitoring?

Event monitoring is used when monitored data of non-continuous events is reported and queried, and alerts are generated. Custom monitoring is used when monitored data collected cyclically and continuously in the time series is reported and queried and alerts are generated.

        2.  On the event list page, click **Create Alert Rule** next to an event.
        3.  Go to the alert rule creation page, enter the alert rule name, select the application group, and set the alert policy and notification mode.
    -   Method two:
        1.  Log in to the cloud monitoring console and enter the application cluster.
        2.  Select an application group and go to the \*\*Event Monitoring\*\* page of the group.
        3.  On the event list page, click \*\*Create Alert Rule\*\* next to an event.

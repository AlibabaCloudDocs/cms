# View cloud service events {#concept_wh4_jjb_wdb .concept}

Event monitoring allows you to query and view statistics of all system events that are generated by various cloud services. You can obtain an overview of how those services are running.

After you use application groups to classify resources, service-related system events are automatically associated with the resources of different groups. This helps you integrate all kinds of monitoring information, and quickly analyze and locate problems.

# Use alarm templates {#concept_bss_b45_vdb .concept}

The alarm template function allows you to save alarm rules in templates so that when you create an alarm rule, you do not need to define alarm rules repeatedly. We recommend that you use alarm templates to improve over efficiency, especially for complex business operations.

Alarm templates must be used together with application groups. You can create alarm templates and apply these templates to your application groups to quickly create alarm rules for different business modules.

By default, CloudMonitor provides an initialized alarm template that contains common metrics for products such as ECS, RDS, SLB, CDN, Redis, MongoDB, and OSS.

**Note:** 

-   Alarm templates apply only to application groups, meaning that alarm templates can be used only when you select application groups as the resource range for an alarm rule.
-   Each Alibaba Cloud account can contain a maximum of 100 alarm templates.
-   Each alarm template can contain up to 30 metrics.
-   The alarm template function only provides a shortcut to create alarm rules. Alarm rules are not bound to alarm templates. After an alarm template is modified, the alarm rules generated by using this template remain unchanged. To modify the alarm rules for different application groups in batches, you must apply the modified template to each application group.

## Use a template {#section_kcs_dy5_vdb .section}

-   Use an alarm template when you create an application group

    When you create an application group for your resources, you can select an existing alarm template in the **MonitorAlarm** area. After the application group is created successfully, CloudMonitor generates alarm rules for this group according to the selected alarm template.

-   Apply an alarm template directly to an application group

    If you have created an application group but have not created alarm rules for the group, you can create an alarm template and then quickly apply the template to the group.

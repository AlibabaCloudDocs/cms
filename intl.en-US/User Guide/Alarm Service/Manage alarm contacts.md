# Manage alarm contacts {#concept_dm3_dnb_5db .concept}

The contact and contact group information is a prerequisite for the alarm rule function. This is because when any data exception occurs, an alarm is triggered and the alarm notification is sent to the alarm contact and the alarm contact group. The alarm notifications can be sent through text message, an email or TradeManager. Hence, it is required to create a contact and a contact group when you begin to use the alarm rules function for the first time.

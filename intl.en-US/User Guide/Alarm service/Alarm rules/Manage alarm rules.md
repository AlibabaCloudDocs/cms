CloudMonitor provides monitoring and alarms for your cloud services, and helps you timely locate exceptional metrics and efficiently perform troubleshooting.

You can start to manage alarm rules in the CloudMonitor console in three ways: in the left-side navigation pane, choose Application Groups to go to the Application Groups page, or choose a required monitoring type to go to the corresponding monitoring metrics page, or choose Alarms \> Alarm Rules to go to the Alarm Rules page.

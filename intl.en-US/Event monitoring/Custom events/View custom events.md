# View custom events

Event monitoring provides a centralized platform for you to query and analyze custom events that are generated for different Alibaba Cloud services. This allows you to view the monitoring data of custom events and receive alert notifications. This way, you can efficiently analyze and troubleshoot issues when business exceptions occur.

Custom events are reported. For more information, see [Overview](/intl.en-US/Event monitoring/Custom events/Report custom events/Overview.md).

# Cloud service monitoring

Cloud Monitor automatically monitors resources of each cloud service under your Alibaba Cloud account. You can view the monitoring data about resources of each cloud service in monitoring charts. You can also configure alert rules to monitor resources. When an alert is triggered based on the configured alert rules, Cloud Monitor sends an alert notification. This way, you are notified of performance or usage anomalies immediately after the anomalies occur.

The monitoring data that is displayed on the monitoring page varies with cloud services. For example, you can view the instance list and monitoring charts on the monitoring page of Server Load Balancer \(SLB\). You can also configure alert rules on the monitoring page.

5.  On the displayed page, add monitoring charts as needed.

## Add a monitoring chart {#section_xzb_rwv_tdb .section}

You can add major cloud product metrics and your service metrics to the dashboard.

If you use multiple cloud products for your application, you can add the cloud product metrics to the same dashboard by adding a monitoring chart, so that you can view the global cloud product monitoring data.

When you report your service monitoring data by using the CloudMonitor API, you can add a monitoring chart to display the monitoring data.

**Procedure**

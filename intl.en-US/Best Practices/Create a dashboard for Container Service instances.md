# Create a dashboard for Container Service instances {#concept_xsf_r5q_zdb .concept}

## Scenario {#section_sk3_mvq_zdb .section}

With the development of cloudization, more and more enterprise users deploy services directly in Container Service. When the number of Container Service instances increases, enterprise users need a dashboard to reflect heat loads of all instances. With such a dashboard, users can learn about the global status of the instances.

To cater to the need, CloudMonitor offers a Dashboard function that is interoperable with the Container Service monitoring function.

## Procedure {#section_hrt_mvq_zdb .section}

1.  Log on to the [CloudMonitor Console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/cms).
2.  From the left-side navigation pane, choose **Dashboard** \> **Custom Dashboard**.
3.  On the Dashboards page, click **Create Dashboard** in the upper-right corner.
4.  In the created dashboard, click **Add View**.
5.  In the Chart Type area, click **Heat Map**.
6.  On the **Dashboards** tab page in the Select Metrics area, select **Container Service** from the drop-down list, and then select the required metrics and resource.
7.  Click **Save**. The following figure shows the heat map rendering.

    In the upper-right corner, click **Full Screen** to view the full-screen rendering.

    You can create multiple independent charts in a dashboard, and each chart reflects the monitoring conditions of a product \(for example, ECS, RDS, or SLB\). You can also view the full-screen rendering of the dashboard.

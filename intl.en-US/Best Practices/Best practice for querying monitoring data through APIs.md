# Best practice for querying monitoring data through APIs {#concept_axh_33l_ggb .concept}

## Background information {#section_y4p_4jl_ggb .section}

Large-sized enterprises typically have their own O&M systems. When moving businesses to the cloud, these enterprises must integrate the cloud resource monitoring data with their existing systems. This topic describes how to use CloudMonitor APIs to query the monitoring data of various services and integrate Apsara Stack monitoring data into your existing systems.

## Prerequisites {#section_rwj_5ps_ggb .section}

Before you query monitoring data through APIs, we recommend that you learn about the three types of APIs provided by CloudMonitor to query monitoring data:

-   QueryProjectMeta: queries which services can be monitored by CloudMonitor. For more information, see [../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_64/DNCMS11853671/EN-US\_TP\_69876.md\#](../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/Query monitoring data/QueryProjectMeta.md#).
-   QueryMetricMeta: queries which metrics are available for a monitored service. For more information, see [../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_64/DNCMS11853671/EN-US\_TP\_67480.md\#](../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/Query monitoring data/QueryMetricMeta.md#).
-   QueryMetricList and QueryMetricLast: query monitoring data by service and metric. For more information, see [../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_64/DNCMS11853671/EN-US\_TP\_14268.md\#](../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/Query monitoring data/QueryMetricList.md#) and [../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_64/DNCMS11853671/EN-US\_TP\_14267.md\#](../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/Query monitoring data/QueryMetricLast.md#).

## Procedure {#section_qcp_sjl_ggb .section}

**Precautions**

-   QueryMetricList and QueryMetricLast allow you to query data for a certain metric for all your instances. To query data for multiple metrics, you can create multiple threads, or create a single thread to cyclically obtain data of different metrics.
-   QueryMetricList supports up to 20 queries per second \(QPS\) and QueryMetricLast supports up to 30 QPS.
-   QueryMetricLast is applicable to scenarios where you need to regularly obtain the most recent monitoring data. The time window automatically slides forward. The latest data is obtained in each period.
-   There may be a gap between the occurrence of an event and the time when it is monitored. The gap varies with service. We recommend that you extend the time window to 5 to 10 minutes when using QueryMetricLast to query the latest data.
-   Data that is obtained every few seconds is stored for 7 days. Data that is obtained every few minutes is stored for 31 days.
-   You do not need to specify Dimensions to query the data of all your instances.

**Case study**

The following example demonstrates how to use QueryMetricLast to query the latest monitoring data and use QueryMetricList to query the monitoring data in a specified time range.

# Scenarios {#concept_iwv_1p4_tdb .concept}

CloudMonitor provides an extensive array of scenarios. The following are the various scenarios, explained with the help of examples of different services.

## Cloud service monitoring {#section_idw_zq4_tdb .section}

Once you buy and use the Alibaba Cloud service supporting CloudMonitor, you can easily check the running status of your products and various metrics on the corresponding cloud service monitoring chart page. Moreover, you can set alarm policies for different metrics as well.

## System monitoring {#section_shs_1r4_tdb .section}

System monitoring enables you to keep check on the CPU and memory usage, outgoing public network traffic rate \(bandwidth\), and the other basic indicators of any ECS instance. Thus, you can use instances more appropriately and avoid service malfunction due to resource overuse.

## Rapid exception handling {#section_apc_gr4_tdb .section}

On the basis of the alarm rules you set, CloudMonitor sends notifications when metric data reaches the threshold. These alarms help you to receive timely exception notifications, diagnose the cause and take appropriate action in time.

## Rapid resizing {#section_qjj_lr4_tdb .section}

You can set alarm rules for multiple metrics such as bandwidth, connection count and disk usage. This helps you to know the realtime status of cloud services and resize them \(as per the requirement\) when the alarm is triggered due to increase in the service volume.

## Site monitoring {#section_ryw_4r4_tdb .section}

Currently, site monitoring service supports eight monitoring protocols namely HTTP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, DNS, POP3, SMTP, and FTP.Â  This helps to detect the availability, response time and packet loss rate of your site. It also gives you the complete picture of the site availability and fix the exceptions immediately.

## Custom monitoring {#section_el2_qr4_tdb .section}

Custom monitoring is designed as a supplement to the Cloud Service Monitoring. If CloudMonitor fails to provide you the expected metrics, you can create a new metric and report the acquired metric data to CloudMonitor. This is when the CloudMonitor displays monitoring charts and raise alarms for new metrics.

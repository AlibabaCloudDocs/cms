# Scenarios

After you purchase and use Alibaba Cloud services supported by Cloud Monitor, Cloud Monitor can help you monitor the resources of these services. Cloud Monitor can monitor your resources in the following scenarios.

## Cloud service monitoring

Cloud Monitor monitors the resources of all cloud services within your Alibaba Cloud account. You can view the status of the specified resources and the usage of metrics in the cloud service. You can also configure alert rules for the metrics. If an alert is triggered based on the alert rules, Cloud Monitor sends an alert notification.

## Host monitoring

Cloud Monitor can monitor the basic metrics of an Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instance to ensure that the instance runs as expected. The basic metrics include CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage.

## Timely troubleshooting

Cloud Monitor sends an alert notification based on the alert rules if a metric exceeds the specified threshold. This allows you to know, query, and handle the exceptions at the earliest opportunity.

## Timely scaling

After you configure alert rules for monitoring metrics such as bandwidth, connections, and disk usage, you can monitor the status of cloud services. If your business expands, you can receive alert notifications to scale out your cloud services at the earliest opportunity.

## Site monitoring

Cloud Monitor can monitor sites by using HTTP \(HTTPS\), ICMP, TCP, UDP, DNS, SMTP, POP3, and FTP. Cloud Monitor monitors the availability, response time, and packet loss rate of your site. This allows you to monitor the overall site availability and handle exceptions at the earliest opportunity.

## Custom monitoring

If the system metrics cannot meet your requirements, Cloud Monitor allows you to create custom metrics. The monitoring data of custom metrics is collected and reported to Cloud Monitor. Cloud Monitor displays monitoring charts and provides the alert service for the custom metrics.

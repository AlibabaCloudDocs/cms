# Scenarios

Cloud Monitor applies to a wide range of scenarios.

## Cloud service monitoring

After you activate and use Alibaba Cloud services supported by Cloud Monitor, you can view the running status and metrics of the services in the Cloud Monitor console. You can also configure alert rules for the metrics.

## Host monitoring

Cloud Monitor monitors the basic metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and outbound bandwidth of your Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances. This ensures that the instances run properly and prevents service interruption due to resource overuse.

## Timely troubleshooting

Based on the alert rules that you configure, Cloud Monitor sends an alert notification immediately if any metric exceeds the specified threshold. This allows you to start troubleshooting immediately when exceptions occur.

## Resource scale-out

After you configure alert rules for metrics such as the bandwidth, connection count, and disk usage, you can receive alert notifications about the usage of your cloud resources. If the existing resources cannot meet your business requirements, you can scale out the resources as required.

## Site monitoring

Cloud Monitor can monitor sites by using HTTP \(HTTPS\), ICMP, TCP, UDP, DNS, SMTP, POP3, and FTP. Cloud Monitor monitors the availability, response time, and packet loss rate of your site. This allows you to get a comprehensive view of the site availability and fix exceptions if any.

## Custom monitoring

Custom monitoring is designed as a supplement to cloud service monitoring. If Cloud Monitor does not provide metrics that you expect, you can create a metric, collect monitoring data, and then report the data to Cloud Monitor. Then, Cloud Monitor displays monitoring charts and sends alert notifications based on the new metric.

# Scenarios {#concept_iwv_1p4_tdb .concept}

CloudMonitor applies to various scenarios.

## Cloud service monitoring {#section_idw_zq4_tdb .section}

After you purchase and use the Alibaba Cloud services supported by CloudMonitor, you can easily view the running status and various monitoring metrics of your products, and set alarm rules for the metrics on the corresponding product page of CloudMonitor.

## System monitoring {#section_shs_1r4_tdb .section}

By monitoring the basic metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, outbound public network traffic rate \(bandwidth\) of the ECS, you can ensure the normal use of instances and avoid service malfunction due to resource overuse.

## Rapid exception handling {#section_apc_gr4_tdb .section}

According to the alarm rules you set, CloudMonitor sends an alarm notification when metric data reaches the threshold, so that you can get the alarm notification and query the cause of the exception in time.

## Rapid scale-out {#section_qjj_lr4_tdb .section}

After setting alarm rules for monitoring metrics such as bandwidth, connection count, and disk usage, you can easily learn about the real-time status of cloud services and scale them out if an alarm notification is triggered due to an increase in the service volume.

## Site monitoring {#section_ryw_4r4_tdb .section}

Site monitoring currently supports eight protocols, namely HTTP\(HTTPS\), ICMP, TCP, UDP, DNS, POP3, SMTP, and FTP. This helps to detect the availability, response time, and packet loss rate of your site, so that you can get a comprehensive view of the site availability and fix the exception, if any, in time.

## Custom monitoring {#section_el2_qr4_tdb .section}

Custom monitoring is designed as a supplement to cloud service monitoring. If CloudMonitor fails to provide you the expected metrics, you can create a new metric and report the acquired metric data to CloudMonitor. CloudMonitor then displays monitoring charts and raises alarms for new metrics.
